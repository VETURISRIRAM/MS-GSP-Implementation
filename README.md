The dataset files should be stored in the data/input folder. It should contain the 'data.txt' and 'parameters.txt' files.
The python file 'final.py' draws the input datasets from the above mentioned folders.

The code has been written in Python3. When you run the python file 'final.py', you would get the output file in 'txt' format as output.txt file in the data/input folder only. It has the generated candidate and frequent sequential pattern sets.
